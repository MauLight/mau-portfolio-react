As it turns out, people and characters always want something, whether it’s some basic need like food or shelter up to the craziest of human endeavors Thing is, to understand the want of a character is to understand their motivation.',
    par2: 'Let’s say you’re a detective, just for the sake of understanding, okay? So, maybe you want to catch the criminal, that’s your want, your motivation for moving your fat ass (filled with donuts and cheap coffee) into action. But maybe, as you go deep into the investigation, you come to realize that the killer is your little kid, turns out the sucker is an acolyte of the devil, a demon, for the non-initiated. So, what do we have here? Conflicting wishes. The motivation line is to catch the criminal. But the desire line is to protect your family. Isn’t that wonderful? Now you have a compelling story about a self-righteous detective who wants to uphold the law, yet can’t go against their baby, finding that their true desire is to protect their family. What will they do?',
    par3: 'I guess it would also depend on another aspect of the character development, their NEED. So, what is this need thing? Well, in simple lame terms it is overcoming a flaw inherent in their personality. Okay, so the idea here is for us to choose a powerful inciting incident that forces the character out of their flawed life and into the story. Now, why would they NEED to go through such an ordeal? Because it seems that this is the only way to resolve their flaw, by addressing it in an external situation which is comprised of the world of the story and the antagonism.',

    par1: 'As an invisible force guiding every movement of creation, Theme might stand as the most important aspect of any artistic creation. Think of theme as the symbolic argument between a posited truth and a lie, two opposing aspects of some idea that will play out in the characters’ arcs and throughout an external plot, which in turn will force characters’ growth. Generally speaking, theme is a uniform idea or subject, explored via recurring patterns and expanded through comparisons and contrast.',
    par2: 'So, how can you find the theme of a story? Look for the truth at the heart of any prominent character change within the plot. Then, identify any underlying topics or recurring motifs repeated throughout your plot and characters’ decisions. But take special notice of the ending of your story, because this is where ultimately the theme is expressed or revealed as a truth discovered or accepted by the protagonist (often called a self-revelation). This truth is often called the thematic point, once discovered, you can play it back against everything that happened previously in the plot and characters’ development. Ideally, you will see it resonate in every scene, if not you should strive for it to happen.',
    par3: 'Now, let’s talk a bit about the differences between using and finding a theme for your story. If we start a story from a theme, we can actually mold the plot and characters into a visual and external metaphor for an invisible theme. But if we don’t, let’s say we started with character or plot, the idea is not to construct a metaphor, but rather discover one inside our story. In this case, we should look within the existing/evolving plot to identify the emerging theme.',

    par1: 'As we discussed before, a theme is an argument between two posited ideas, a TRUTH, and a LIE. And so, a thematic premise has two opposite sides; A truth that must be discovered and a lie that is believed. Discovered and believed by whom you might ask. Well, obviously we’re talking about the story’s protagonist, right? Do you remember when we talked about needs and wants? Think about it like this; Truth = Need and Lie= Want.',
    par2: 'Most of the time, a protagonist enters the plot because they believe some lie that is expressed as a desire or want. Yet in reality, what they really need is to get a sense of a deeper truth they can’t initially see. This truth has the power to make them change in profound ways. A character’s conflict with others or with the world of the story is almost inevitably a reflection and/or a projection of inner conflicts. In other words, the plot reflects/projects the character’s inner struggle upon an external world. Also, lies and truths will often translate into literal objects, persons, or states within the external plot. At the root of it, there’s a ghost from the character’s past. Remember what ghost is? Simply put… TRAUMA!',
    par3: 'The ghost or trauma makes the character believe a lie that throws them into the plot because of their desires, then facing rising action that expresses many variations on the theme being conveyed and ending in the plot goal or objective, where the truth the character needs to grow is expressed. So, the protagonist’s final choice in the story is between what they want and what they need and it will mostly be externalized in a metaphor that proves a corresponding choice between the lie and the truth.',
