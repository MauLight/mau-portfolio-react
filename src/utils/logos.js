  text1: 'This phrase sums up the knowledge I’ve gathered throughout my life. Every plan, every endeavor we go through can be thought of as a series of steps. The methods that we apply to break our efforts into these essential steps impacts tremendously in our chances to achieve the goals we’ve set up. To achieve the impossible, you have to face the challenge in such a way that you can optimize your efforts, and experience lends you a hand at assessing times and requirements.',
  quote: 'It always amazes me how the most beautiful things start being nothing more than a sparkling idea waiting to fulfill its potential.',
  text2: 'When we achieve the results, when we get to the finish line, the excitement fills us and the joy of success comes to us. It is not after facing new challenges that we realize just how much we’ve grown, how much more we’ve improved. It is called effort, and falling in love with effort drives us to achieve unimaginable things. Technique, capacity, talent… all of these things start with the capacity to stay in course and applying your efforts in a systematic way.',
  text3: 'As a photographer and a filmmaker, I’ve learned first hand how effort and process results in amazing results. After all, art is all about the process! It is always about the discovery of something that doesn’t exists until you make it happen. And there is no better place to learn about process and effort that in screenwriting, because writing without a plan, without a structure, leads to nowhere.',
  text4: 'And all of these attitudes, habits and mindsets come in handy when you’re facing a software development challenge. Because it is in learning difficult things that having a proper structure and applying effort, loving the process, brings the best results. Loving the process, finding the paths that lead to solving complex problems, that’s the right attitude to face coding, but don’t forget to share and rely on others, because team work makes any challenge 100% easier to accomplish.'
